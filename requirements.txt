## Dependencies

- PHP must be installed on your operating system (any version, 5 or 7).

- You will need to clone the **[`hd-wallet-derive`](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive)** tool.

- **[`bit`](https://ofek.dev/bit/)** Python Bitcoin library.
- **[`web3.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py)** Python Ethereum library.

## hd-wallet-derive Installation

Execute the following steps:

* Navigate to the [Github website](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive) for the `hd-wallet-derive` library and scroll down to the installation instructions.

* Next, open a terminal and execute the following commands. If you are using Windows, you will need to open the `git-bash` GUI via `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe` directly to enable something called `tty` mode that makes the terminal more compatible with Unix systems. Once installed, you may move back to using the usual `git-bash` terminal.

 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
 cd hd-wallet-derive
 php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
 php -d pcre.jit=0 composer.phar install
 ```

* You should now have a folder called `hd-wallet-derive` containing the PHP library.

## hd-wallet-derive Execution
